          <h2>Explore Nature</h2>
          <p>The primary focus of Naturalist Trips is learning about the natural world. Topics may include identifying flora, fungi, or fauna, discussing geology, learning about edible plants or social uses of plants, exploring ecological or geologic processes, or pursuing the ecology of various plants and animals. This activity is all about helping participants connect deeper with nature, seeing details that might otherwise be missed. It is about showing participants things in the natural world that might make their experience in the wilds richer and deeper.

          <h2>Look Deep In Nature</h2>
          <p>I’ve heard people describe nature as God’s masterpiece. Whether or not you believe in the divine, it’s hard to dispute the beauty you experience when you explore nature. I find that my creativity thrives when I spend time in nature. And this isn’t the racing creativity that I experience during mania. It is a creativity that produces ideas that are rich, calm and deep.

            An important part of achieving bliss is cultivating creativity because it helps build self-esteem.
